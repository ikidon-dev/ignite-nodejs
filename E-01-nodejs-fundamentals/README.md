      Todo API - NodeJS
    </strong>
  </h2>

  <p>This project consists of an API created only using the modules present in NodeJS, except for the <a href="https://csv.js.org/parse/">csv-parse</a> library, which was used to consume large csv files.</p>

## Biggest challenge

<p>My biggest challenge in this project was understanding how Regex works and how to work with the NodeJS Stream module</p>
